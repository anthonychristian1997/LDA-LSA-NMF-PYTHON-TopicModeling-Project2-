# TopicModeling-PYTHON-Project2-
In this repository, I show only the methods I use in searching for topics in data. This repository features the Sk-Learn library for searching existing topics.

In using the Sklearn library, three methods can be used to search for topics:

1. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
2.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3.Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NFM)

In this repository, I use these three methods to find the best topic. The more accurate the topic, the better suited the method will be to the existing data.
